## Philosophy 
- Runs entirely in browser, using JavaScript, PHP, and other basic web technologies.
- To view a live demo, swap the names of the directories "database" & "database_sample".
- The database stored in basic text (.csv) files.
- I am currently distributing it for free, but am retaining the copyright for the time being. 
- To see a live demo, go to [www.cwholemaniii.com/code/cwesst/](http://cwholemaniii.com/code/cwesst/)

## To Run
1. Download .zip file.
2. Extract it.
3. Ensure your environment can run PHP. (Most websites by default)
4. Password protect the entire cwesst folder to ensure no one else can access the private details of your books, not to mention publishers, etc. (Optional, but **HIGHLY** recommended.)
6. Access cwesst/index.php from a browser.
