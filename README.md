## To Run
1. Download .zip file.
2. Extract it.
3. Ensure your environment can run PHP. (Most websites by default)
4. Password protect the entire cwesst folder to ensure no one else can acccess the private details of your books, not to mention publishers, etc. (Optional, but **HIGHLY** recommended.)
